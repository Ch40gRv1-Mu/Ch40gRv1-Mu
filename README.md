ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Changrui
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in stuff related to Alrorithm and Cryptographyã€‚
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cryptography myself as well as Competitive programing for fun  
âœ… I'm currently working on Weibo crawler and WeiXin crawler in the position of Student Researcher in NUS  
ðŸ‘¬ I'm also helping my friend Haohan designing a NLP related recommendation medeling  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: It seems not secure to leak too many information online right? But hopes my projects can help you, good luck!
